A series of semi-related computer design projects I've been working on.  Please see
the individual project directories for details on each

Z80-NCQ is Not Quite a Computer.  It has onboard EEPROM and SRAM but no I/O.  An
arduino can be connected to the expansion bus to use as I/O.

68k-SBC is a Single Board Computer using a 68000/68010 CPU.  It has 64kB EEPROM and
1MB SRAM, along with a 68681 Dual UART controller.
